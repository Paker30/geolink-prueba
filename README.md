Why did I have choosen Angular2 over other options?
Nowadays there are many options if you want to developer a front-end web-app in JS, you can choose between differents frameworks (Angular,
React, Vue, ...) and also develop it in plain JS (Vanilla JS). In my case, I've choosen working with Angular2 because it's the one I feel more
comfortable, I can develop quicker and know how to implement many of the issiues I have to handle, on the other hand, I also like it more 
than React, I find Angular2 similar to React but you don't have to take into account so many style rules, besides I find the structure of 
Angular2 elements easier to handle. I also could have choosen plain JS, it would have been the lightest way to do it but in the case any one 
wants to add new funcionality it's quite difficult (unless there're some styles rules)

Issues in the exercise
About the graph, you could see that there are 3 different areas but, when you pass the mouse over it, only two of them are highlight, I 
know I have an error on the library I've found but I haven't been able to fixed it (it works great with two areas) On the test part, 
I've never had to work with testing in my profesinal carier, I know how they work and how to use them but I had issues with webpack and 
css, when I run the test I've done just to check the test runs, an error appears. I don't know why it happens but I'm almost sure it's
related with CSS
